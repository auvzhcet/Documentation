## Rules and directions for documentation

### Why document

The sole purpose of this initiative is to keep on the chain of knowledge intact. The founding members had suffered the break in the lineage and took around 3 years to develop from scratch and we don't want the upcoming teams to do the same.
This documentation is important for each of the members of the organization. This will be used by the next batch of members as well as by the junior members to learn and tackle issues related to the tasks from scratch. This will also help your peers to understand the tasks performed by you and analyze it to give any positive criticisms.
Most importantly, This will act as proof of the team members work wherever he/she apply for whether it be for masters or jobs. This will act as a 'Technical Report' and proof of your efforts while you stay in the club.

### How to document

### What to document

1. Any novel procedure/technique used apart of previously documented work in the same field
2. Usage of new equipments/tools/Softwares/boards that were not previously used and its usage had drastically improved the working of the vehicle
3. A new idea/concept (which has already proven by other teams but couldn't be completed under the team members tenure in the club and he/she has to transfer this idea to the juniors) that has been used for improving the efficiency and design of the vehicle
4. Any undocumented but significant basic procedure that is used in the working of the vehicle
5. Any undocumented work that was previously left incomplete/neglected by the seniors

### What NOT to document

1. Those which do not have concrete evidence for the result (The student can better read plenty of research papers without a concrete goal)
2. Comparative studies - This is not journal publishing stories. here students must benefit fro the technique and not stay confused while choosing one.

some rules that everyone has to follow for uniformity in the information collected.

### Format of docs

1. Always start with a heading.
2. Then describe the goal
3. move on to describe the steps involved for reaching the goal (From theoretical knowledge - practical steps)
    - This must include the links
    - The **exact** steps to be followed from the given links(include the misconceptions and the blunders that you did while doing the same - be a senpai to a newborn!!!)
    - The output/result
    - [OPTIONAL but IMPORTANT] If the team members had chosen a different path earlier to execute the task and it turned out to be delusional; add those techniques and results too
4. Finish it off with writing the name of the team member who performed it with their contact details

### Hierarchy of Submission

1. The docs have to be written in the above format and then submitted to their respective team heads
2. Who will attest the completion of the work (OR IF NOT COMPLETED; he/she will give his witness about the experimentation performance)
3. Compile all the docs from **all** the team members and submit to the coordinator
4. The coordinator will upload it on the central repository

> NOTE: The member can either directly push his edits in the central repo on [Github] and the above same procedure is to be followed before the coordinator pulls it in the main repo.

Or the students can submit the content as **.txt** file and it will be uploaded in the main repo

## Role of Team heads

1. Make sure that no two team members have written the same content
2. If it's a collaborated work; the contribution of each team member with equal effort has to be acknowledged
3. The content provided by the members does not resemble any previous work [Check central repo].

## Role of the coordinator

1. Collect all the docs from each team head after rectification
2. Pull requests once the team head gives a green flag
3. Upload .txt files in the main repo and add the link in front of the respected topics
4. Handle any discrepancies from the team members
5. Handle queries from any person trying to know about the content
6. Handle content from non-club members (Club alumni/experts)
