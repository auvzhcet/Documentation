# Robot Operating System (ROS) and Gazebo

The use of Robot Operating System is important because it helps in proper functioning of each nodes independently and shows the perfect example of distributed systems.
The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications.
The software stack for any robot platform needs several software tools like hardware drivers, networking modules, communication architecture, and several robot algorithms. ROS has all these tools under one umbrella so developers do not need to reinvent the wheel.

The use of rosserial is important to load sensor data from microcontrollers and process it using ros. It also used for connecting with other non-linux programs to connect with ROS.
