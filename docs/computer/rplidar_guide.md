# Guide to RPLidar-A1

This is a simple guide to set-up the Lidar and run few demo applications on a Windows Machine. This is in now way a comprehensive guide to set-up RP Lidar for programming needs. It's scope is only limited to running Demo.

For setting it up and utilizing it's ROS compatibility follow their official [GitHub Repo][slamtec-public-repo]

## About RPLidar-A1

RPLidar-A1 is 360* omnidirectional laser range scanner used to generate an outline map for the environment and ideal for applying SLAM algorithms. It works on laser triangulation ranging principle and uses high-speed vision acquisition and processing hardware developed by Slamtec. [Link to Official Website](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A1)

It uses UART to communicate with the host device. However, Slamtec has been generous enough to provide a chipset to communicate via USB COM Ports using USB to UART Bridge Virtual COM Port(VCP) Drivers.

**General Applications:**

1. Robot simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
2. Environment scanning and 3D rebuilding
3. Obstacle detecting and avoiding
4. Multi-point touching and man-machine interaction

**Some general Specifications:**
|Detection Range|Sample Rate|Angular Resolution|Distance Resolution|Typical Scan frequency|
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--:|
|30cm to 12m|8000 Samples/s|1 Degree|0.2cm|5.5 Hz|

## Set-up on Windows

+ Download and install cp2102 Driver (UART VCP driver) from [here](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) to connect it using USB. (_preferable_)
+ Install RoboStudio to connect using WiFi.

## Run Demo

The company provides the following 3 simple demos for fast evaluations:

1. _Ultra_Simple_: This demo application simply connects to the RPLIDAR device and outputs the scan data to the console.
2. _Simple_Grabber_: This application demonstrates the process of getting RPLIDARâ€™s serial number, firmware version and healthy status after connecting the PC and RPLIDAR. Then the demo application grabs two round of scan data and shows the range data as histogram in the command line mode.
3. _Frame_Grabber_: This demo application can show real-time laser scans in the GUI and is only available on Windows platform. It can also be run using RoboStudio.

Checkout Slamtec's [GitHub Repo][slamtec-public-repo] for details on how to run each of them on different machines.

### Run `frame_grabber.exe`

1. Download `rp_lidar_sdk_v1.4.2.7z` from [here](./static/).
2. Extract the all the files to a folder.
3. Navigate to `rp_lidar_sdk_v1.4.2\tools\win32\` or `rp_lidar_sdk_v1.4.2\sdk\prebuild\win32\`.
4. Run `frame_grabber.exe`
5. A dialogue box pops up to select Serial Port and click OK.
   > COM Port number can be found by opening the `Device Manager` and expanding the `Serial COM ports`.
6. Click the **circular Scan button** to start the scanning.

!! Map your surrounding and Enjoy the cool stuff.
