# Simulation Engineer

The simulation engineer in the computer branch has the task of performing all the computations and test hardware codes on the dummy system on the computer. This helps in debugging any errors and allowing the members to rectify it without harming the actual hardware. Even though more, complications are faced when handling real-life tasks, simulations mitigate the effect of major damage that can easily occur, due to human error.

For robotics simulation, some various platforms and engines provide good physics engines. The first one we tried was on Gazebo. You can visit our repository [AUV_ROS_Simulation](https://github.com/auvzhcet/AUV_ROS_Simulation) and the other one was Unity - [AUV_Unity_Simulation](https://github.com/auvzhcet/AUV_Unity_Simulation) to know more about it.
