# Simulation Engineer

The simulation engineer in computer branch has the task of perfroming all the computations and test hardware codes on dummy system on computer. This helps in debugging any errors and allowing the memebers to rectify it without harming the actual hardware. Even more complications are faced when handling real-life tasks, simulation mitigates the affect of major damage that can easily occur, due to human error.

For robotics simulation there are various platforms and engines that provide good physics engines. The first one we tried was on Gazebo. You can visit our repository [AUV_ROS_Simulation](https://github.com/auvzhcet/AUV_ROS_Simulation) and [AUV_Unity_Simulation](https://github.com/auvzhcet/AUV_Unity_Simulation) to know more about it.
