# Git and Github

**Objective**: To learn git and github.

**Introduction**: Git is used to store the source code for a project and track the complete history of all changes to that code. It allows developers to collaborate on a project more effectively by providing tools for managing possibly conflicting changes from multiple developers. GitHub allows developers to change, adapt and improve software from its public or private repositories.

**Equipments/Software used**: Gitbash

**Procedure** : Followed some tutorials. [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WbwIoQYP6no)

**Results** : Completed

**Future work** : To collaborate with team on bigger projects.

# Linux Command Interface

**Objective**: To get comfortable with the Linux Command Line.

**Introduction**: The Command Line Interface (CLI), is a non-graphical, text-based interface to the computer system, where the user types in a command and the computer then successfully executes it. The terminal is the platform or the IDE that provides the command line interface (CLI) environment to the user. The CLI terminal accepts the commands that the user types and passes to a shell. The shell then receives and interprets what the user has typed into the instructions that can be executed by the OS (Operating System)

**Equipments/Software used**: Linux OS.

**Procedure**: Followed some tutorials. [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS1QulWo1RIb9WVQGJ_vh-RQusbZgO_As)

**Results**: Completed

**Future work**: To contribute in major open source projects.

# Computer Vision(OpenCv)

**Objective**: To learn object detection, Image processing, video processing.

**Introduction**: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in the commercial products. Being a BSD-licensed product, OpenCV makes it easy for businesses to utilize and modify the code.

**Equipments/Software used**: Pycharm.

**Procedure**: Followed some tutorials. [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdLM6AOd2vc&list=PLS1QulWo1RIa7D1O6skqDQ-JZ1GGHKK-K)

**Results**: Completed

**Future work**: To use this technology in our ROV to detect objects.

# Python

**Objective**: To explore the language and understand the code written using OpenCV.

**Introduction**: Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.

**Equipments/Software used**: pycharm, python IDLE.

**Procedure**: Followed some tutorials. [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsyeobzWxl7poL9JTVyndKe62ieoN-MZ3)

**Results**: Completed

**Future work**: To write scripts using OpenCV-python for the ROV.

# Raspberry Pi

**Objective**: To learn how to work with raspberry pi.

**Introduction**: Raspberry Pi is the name of a series of single-board computers made by the Raspberry Pi Foundation, a UK charity that aims to educate people in computing and create easier access to computing education.The Raspberry Pi is a very cheap computer that runs Linux, but it also provides a set of GPIO (general purpose input/output) pins that allow you to control electronic components for physical computing and explore the Internet of Things (IoT).

**Equipments/Software used**: Raspberry pi, raspbian, HDMI Cable, Memory Card, wires.

**Procedure**: Followed some tutorials. [Reference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpseX2ylEuw&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDesV8WWHLLXW_avmTzHmJLv)

**Results**: In Progress

**Future work**: To use in ROV project.

# Web Development

**Objective**: To make interactive websites/webapps.

**Introduction**: Web development is the building and maintenance of websites; it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.

**Equipments/Software used**: Visual studio code, AWS, cloud9.

**Procedure**: Followed some youtube and udemy tutorials. [Reference](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/)

**Results**: Completed

**Future work**: To contribute in already existing website of AUV club.
