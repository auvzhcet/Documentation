# Documentation

## Rules and directions for documentation

### Why document

The sole purpose of this initiative is to keep on the chain of knowledge intact. The founding members had suffered the break in the lineage and took around 3 years to develop from scratch and we don't want the upcoming teams to do the same.
This documentation is important for each of the members of the club. This will be used by the next batch of members as well as junior members to learn and tackle issues related to the tasks from scratch. This will also help your peers to understand the tasks performed by you and analyze it to give any positive criticisms.
Most importantly, this will act as proof of the team member's work wherever he/she applies for whether it be for masters or jobs. This will act as a 'Technical Report' and proof of your efforts while you stay in the club.

### How to document

Before commanding everyone to start writing, I would like to list why documenting is important.

### What to document

1. Any novel procedure/technique used apart of previously documented work in the same field.
2. Usage of new equipments/tools/softwares/boards that were not previously used and its usage had drastically improved the working of the vehicle.
3. A new idea/concept (which has already proven by other teams but couldn't be completed under the team members tenure in the club and he/she has to transfer this idea to the juniors) that has been used for improving the efficiency and design of the vehicle.
4. Any undocumented but significant basic procedure that is used in the working of the vehicle.
5. Any undocumented work that was previously left incomplete/neglected by the seniors.

### What NOT to document

1. Those which do not have concrete evidence for the result (The student can better read plenty of research papers without a concrete goal).
2. Comparative studies - This is not journal publishing stories. Here students must benefit from the technique and not stay confused while choosing one.

Some other rules that everyone has to follow for uniformity in the information collected:

#### Format of docs

The report must be in the format:

```title:``` Title of the report

```author(s):``` Name of the authors

```email-id(s):```Email id of all the authors

```Objective:``` Main goal of the task or learning

```Introduction:``` small theory of the techniques/equipments used for the task to be done

```Equipments/Softwares used:``` Hardware used, softwares with its versions

```Procedure:``` Write in simple terms which when replicated by any team member. Point wise.

```Results:``` if the work was completed OR expected result when the experiment couldn't be completed

```Future work:``` what future steps can be taken to enhance your work

**You can submit in .docx files or push to Github documentation repo.**

### Hierarchy of Submission

1. The docs have to be written in the above format and then submitted to their respective team heads.
2. The team heads will attest the completion of the work (OR IF NOT COMPLETED; he/she will give his witness about the experimentation performance).
3. Compile all the docs from **all** the team members and submit to the coordinator.
4. The coordinator will upload it on the central repository.

### Role of Team heads

1. Make sure that no two team members have written the same content.
2. If it's a collaborated work; the contribution of each team member with equal effort has to be acknowledged.
3. The content provided by the members does not resemble any previous work.

### Role of the coordinator

1. Collect all the docs from each team head after rectification.
2. Pull requests once the team head gives a green flag.
3. Upload .txt files in the main repo and add the link in front of the respected topics.
4. Handle any discrepancies from the team members.
5. Handle queries from any person trying to know about the content.
6. Handle content from non-club members (Club alumni/experts).
