# Marketing Doc

A marketing team acts as the backbone of a technical club. The club can't make progress without proper representation in the public domain. A marketing team member has to be of a mindset of converting the geeky idea of a company into layman terms and make a profit out of it. This requires an in-depth understanding of the audience and attracting them most easily.

Management is more of understanding human psychology and handling it. When a marketer understands what the customer needs, then he just has to put his communication and outreach skills.

Here in AUV ZHCET, it has always been the core of the club to translate the work into an attractive manner. Since its inception, the club has thrived to increase its performance in the field of underwater robotics. Since this field is new and challenging in the world right now, making newcomers understand its complexity has been a real endeavor.

In this club, you have to interact with freshers, alumni working in various fields, deans/principals for conducting workshops, local vendors, and industrial experts for sponsorships et Cetra. The extreme diversity in the audience makes a management team member exuberantly skilled in marketing and management.
