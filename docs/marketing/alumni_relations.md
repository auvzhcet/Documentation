## Alumni Relations Officer

This is one of the important roles in the management team, as it requires careful ways of managing our alumni. Alumni are passionate about their alma mater and have generously participated in the upliftment of the institution throughout the years. Even our first funding was done during an alumni meet. They are like our Angel Investors. Your task is to win their funds.

The responsibilities of the Alumni relations officer is to:

1. Make a database of all the alumni with their name, email ID, company, contact number, and year of passing.
2. Contacting the alumni through the mail regularly and giving updates of the projects and upcoming competitions
3. Connecting with them on various social media platforms
4. Organizing special visits for them.
5. Making presentations customized to the background of the alumni (technical - non-technical).
6. Organization of the biggest event of the year - 'Alumni Meet':
    a. Contacting any previously connected alumni for a live interactive session.
    b. Connecting with new alumni - Helping them during accommodation, travel, or food.
    c. It's compulsory to join the **Alumni meet official organizing committee** along with other team members.
    d. Connect and be in regular contact with the **Alumni Relations Officer** of the university.
    e. Make sure the maximum amount of alumni touch and interact with our booth.
    f. Pamphlets, Stickers, presentations, videos, and live demonstrations of the vehicle must all be prepared before one month of the event.
7. Contacting potential companies for products/sponsorship with the help of alumni in that company.

Connecting with alumni helps in understanding the perspective of an experienced student of the same university. Their recommendations and ideas will help the club to grow and compete all around the world.
