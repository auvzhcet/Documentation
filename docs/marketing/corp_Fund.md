Corporate funding is asking manufacturing or technical support companies to either support us by providing manufacturing machines or by giving products/equipment in discounted values. This requires a good amount of negotiating skills. Once a deal is cracked it's worth saving a year of funds. The priority list of types of equipment made by the technical heads must be always to be bought first. So its the Corporate funding managers task to extract the material from the company with as less discounted value and as early as possible. Because receiving the final product takes around **4-6 months**. As the replies from these companies are usually delayed, mails are sent to at least 4 more companies selling the same product.

Key points to remember when approaching a company:

1. Always search for alumni working in the company. LinkedIn is a very good place to start. This will help an upper hand in getting to the goal through an employee.
2. When sending an e-mail, add the **mission, vision, and sponsorship benefits** pamphlet along. This helps the company in getting a complete idea about its value of the investment in our club.
3. Follow up emails must be sent after 2 weeks if the reply isn't received.
4. Negotiating prices must be always shared with technical heads and faculty advisors.
5. Contacting and completing the requirement for the shipping agent.
6. Adding the sponsor in our list based on money discounted for the product.
7. Posting about the sponsorship on all social media and websites.
8. Sending an appreciative mail to the sponsors.
