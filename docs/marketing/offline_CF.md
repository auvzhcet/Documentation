## Offline Crowd Funding

Offline crowd fundings are usually done by organizing some games, quick live demonstrations, or something to attract the local public. An example of crowdfunding by AUV ZHCET can be viewed on our Instagram page [(Crowd Funding Event Day 1)](https://www.instagram.com/p/BfOR1dYFS9j/?igshid=1on4booxen41v). For the first time in the university, any club conducted a crowdfunding event for going to international competition. It had a heavy contribution to our funds.

Guide for conducting a crowdfunding campaign:

!!! info ""
    _This guide is based on previous experiences. It is subject to change with new campaigns._

1. A campaign's idea collection and organization must at least start around **3 months** before the actual event. Organization requires collecting crowd funding ideas for games or any attractive event from club members. All the events conducted must be following the rules and regulations of the university and the club.

2. Once the event is decided, fixing the date, time, and place of the event is important.  
    a. If any chief guest is to be invited - then the availability of that person completely depends on the decision of fixing our final date.  
    b. It must not be before any exams.  
    c. The number of days of the event must be decided. _Last time we did was for 2 days._  
    d. Must be at a peak hour - usually during lunchtime but make sure not a lot of students have labs after it when conducting in university.  
    e. The duration of the event must be decided. _Last time it was about 2-3 hours during the lunch break._  
    f. Not on a day when student strengths are very less like on Saturday.  
    g. Can club with any major events happening inside university/college or outside (during City Fair aka Numaish).  
    h. A place must be chosen that has the maximum flow of students/public.  
    i. A safe place for event organizers, materials used and money collected.

3. Announcing about the event  
    a. a week before the event, all social media posts must be updated with the event date, timing, and venue.  
    b. Previous contributors(sponsors)/alumni and professors of the university must be informed about the event through the e-mail.  
    c. Extensive use of Facebook and Instagram features to increase outreach capabilities.  
    d. Every alternate day a reminder of the event must be put on social media platforms every alternate day.  
    e. 24 hours count down just before the event.  
    f. **All the members of the club have to share it maximum on their behalf whether on social media platforms or not.**

4. Event day - D Day  
    a. A structured and safe way of collecting money must be set up.  
    b. **All members** of the clubs including volunteers must be present at the event venue. If the presence of a member at a specific time isn't possible then efficient shifts must be devised by the **event manager**.  
    c. Protect of event managers and members of the club and the props must be **high priority**.  
    d. Live updates must be given on social media platforms.  
    e. **Media Manager** must be available for capturing the events through photos and videos.  
    f. If any chief guest is arriving - required welcome and inauguration must be done.  
    g. A local newspaper journalist must be called for covering the event. (**Make sure the paper publishes it**)  
    h. The total money collected on the day must be submitted to the faculty advisor/treasurer.

5. Post-event
    - Media Manager must make a short video of the event and post it on YouTube
    - The after video and pictures must be posted on the other social media platforms as well.
    - The **event turnout (No. of footsteps)** and a good review must be sent to the alumni/sponsors and other (See point 3b) through the e-mail.
    - Pictures and content must be provided to the PRO (Public Relations Office) of the university to publish it on the official website of AMU.
    - A collage of all the names of contributors can be made and posted on the vehicle or the "Hall of Fame" in the club.

Another offline sponsorship by actually going and asking professors for the money of the competiton and writing their names and signature on "Board of Fame" that will be hung up on the Hall of Fame in the club.
