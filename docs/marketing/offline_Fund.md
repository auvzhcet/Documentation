Offline funds are funds collected from **local vendors, food chains, gyms,**, etc. This requires a consistent visit to local vendors.

Things to remember when going to local vendors:

1. A Sponsorship presentation showing what the project is.
2. Pamphlets with sponsorships details and previous sponsors must be taken along.
3. Contact details must be given for follow up
4. Weekly follow up must be done by visiting their office.
