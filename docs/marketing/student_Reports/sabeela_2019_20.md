## PROCEDURE

### LEARNING ABOUT NEW APPS/SOFTWARE

- Started using CANVA app, this tool acts like a user-friendly version of photoshop. Made use of its template and other feature for our posts.
- Made use of the UNUM and PLANOLY  apps which enable us to handcraft layouts, tailor our grids, save posts to drafts and plan the perfect looking feed.
- I gave the idea of  following a consistent them for our feed in order to make the page appear visually appealing.

### ATTRACT AUDIENCE AND  INCREASE ENGANGEMENT

- Shared our page on several social media platforms.
- Personally texted people to follow and share our page.
- Tagged and gave the required credits to pages and people on every post.
- Used suitable hashtags

### WEVOLVER REPORT

- We came across this report, read it and shared some of the important knowledge we gained with our social media audience through our instagram posts.
- With each post that was posted by us we made sure to tag the wevolver.com pages both on instagram and twitter.
- This eventually made @wevolverapp follow us both on Instagram and twitter ( they have 420k followers on Instagram and 13.8k followers on twitter)

### QUIZ MARATHON

- We organised a one week quiz series – “ TECHNOLOGIA CHARGEMENT” which comprised if MCQ questions  from computer, electrical /electronics and mechanical branches each.
- I designed the templates for these questions which were posted on our instagram story.
- This helped our audience to get basic knowledge and a good number of people participated in it.
- We got an overwhelming response and it helped with our engagement.

### OTHER WORK

- Also I am reading a lot of  articles  & watching videos on how to boost our management/marketing skills , learning to attract more audience.

- A lot of people have been actively interacting with our posts and stories and the quiz marathon also received an active participation of the audience.

- We received recognition from some of the renowned pages from our community- Wevolver.com started following us on Instagram and as well as Twitter.

- Our Instagram page is able to follow and maintain a consistent theme (which is blue as of now) which makes it appear quite visually appealing.
