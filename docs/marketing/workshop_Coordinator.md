_This role has to be in conjunction with any other role in club._
The workshop coordinator has to be more likely to be under the sponsorship manager or the alumni relations officer, as it requires good interaction with connections.

Few of the key responsibilities of the workshop coordinator is:

1. A format of the letter sent to all the previously requested schools/universities for workshops.
2. Make a **package** proposed to be held
    - No. of days for workshop - 2 days/3 days
    - Topics to be covered by Mechanical, Electrical/Electronics, and Computer teams
    - With or without kit
    - Charge - per head
3. Inform the technical leads about the final details of the workshop, so that they start preparing ppts and demonstrations (if any).
4. A complete report of the conducted workshop - Place, Institute held in, attendance of students, how many club members invited, total revenue generated(slashing the total travel & accommodation cost)
5. Any upcoming/incomplete request or possible places/institutes/colleges who showed any amount of interest for conduction of workshop but couldn't be followed up because of preoccupations, inappropriate timing, non-negotiable fees or ending of tenure - mention all the conversations and outcomes in a report and submit to the club.
