- Simulation engineers need to understand the complex environment and the physical components of the technical solution that they are tasked with simulating. Initially, this process involves analysing the needs and liaising with other engineers.
- After this consultation period, simulations engineers should be able to focus their efforts on solving complex mathematical problems and applying their knowledge of scientific phenomena, such as thermodynamics, fluid dynamics and quantum mechanics.
- Should know ANSYS and SolidWorks.
- Based on all this scientific analysis, they should be able to use computer programming languages, such as C++ and Fortran, to model simulated environments. During this process, simulations engineers model a range of different scenarios and variables in quick succession to put the technical solution through its paces and make sure all the bases are covered.
- Simulations engineers need to develop numerical simulations and draw conclusions based on the results of the equations that have been processed. However, from time to time, they may also be tasked with developing simulations which have a graphical user interface (GUI), so that the performance of the solution can be visualised.
- Based on the performance of the solution in the simulated environment, Simulation Engineer should be able to make changes which can be implemented and improvements can be made in the design based on the results.

!!! important
    The simulation engineer is responsible for documenting the project details. He has to provide detailed information regarding all the phases of the projects.
